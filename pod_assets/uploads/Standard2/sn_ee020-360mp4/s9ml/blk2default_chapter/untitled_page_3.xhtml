Ethical considerations, on the other hand, generally spring from within individuals or organizations. However, ethical ideas have been the foundation of much of the legislation enacted by federal, state, and local governments.</p>

Executives who knew the company was headed for bankruptcy quietly sold their shares in the company while encouraging employees to retain and even buy additional shares. After Enron’s eventual collapse, some senior executives, including the CEO, tried to argue that they were unaware of any illegal activity.</p>

            <p id="data-uuid-551944021c674282b246a6f658b86643">As a result of cases like Enron, Congress passed the <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-Sarbanes-Oxley" epub:type="glossref" role="doc-glossref"><dfn xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="Sarbanes-Oxley">Sarbanes–Oxley Act</dfn></a> in 2002, which placed a greater responsibility on upper management to closely monitor the financial dealings and disclosures of their firms. The law also established a board to oversee accounting practices in the United States. The board reports to the Securities and Exchange Commission, a federal agency.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-79ec134b0cbb4956a515c3d7222dd2fd">Consider the role of ethics in the laws that protect consumers against misleading advertising, deceptive labeling, and price-fixing, as well as laws enacted to protect investors from misleading financial information and fraud. These laws are clearly based on ethical considerations. Court decisions, too, are frequently influenced by ethics as judges and juries examine the facts of a case and form beliefs about the parties and issues involved.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-876df1ef522d4c6da8bc2b53f41d1359">A distinction between law and ethics is that legal mandates are usually more precise. The law requires individuals and organizations to behave in specified ways, requiring or prohibiting certain acts. Ethical issues may be multifaceted.</p>

It could have simply fulfilled that requirement. However, the management decided, based on ethical considerations, to increase the pay of their workers beyond the mandated wage, feeling the required minimum was inadequate. While this decision might be commendable from an ethical standpoint, it could involve several other ethical issues as well: The cost of the extra pay might result in higher prices for consumers or reduced earnings for shareholders.</p>
