</header>
<p id="data-uuid-0cada7d331ae42f4877a55d4fbc2deeb">Approached to ethical reasoning can be broadly grouped into two categories: duty-based reasoning and outcome-based reasoning. <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-duty-based-reasoning" epub:type="glossref" role="doc-glossref"><dfn xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="duty based reasoning">Duty-based reasoning</dfn></a> requires that ethical decisions should be based on the consequences of actions and has a corresponding implication that an unethical decision is one that violates the rights of others. For example, an owner of a company may feel that he or she has a duty to provide fair pricing for a product to the consumer because the consumer has a right to a fair price. <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-outsome-based-reasoning" epub:type="glossref" role="doc-glossref"><dfn xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="outsome based reasoning">Outcome-based reasoning</dfn></a>, in contrast, requires analysis of decisions based on creating the greatest good for the most number of people. For example, a company agrees to subsidize the price of milk at a relatively low rate by increasing the price of a more expensive cheese product that the company also sells. The market for milk is much larger, with a diverse income range of purchasers, while the market for the cheese product is smaller and wealthier.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-437b3731eaf5442c9a07622f5b4a1959">The growing awareness of the importance of ethics is evident in the responses of businesses, educational institutions, governments, and trade and professional associations.</p>

</header>
<p id="data-uuid-888ae17c2a504ebea4c02c6c6b11c952">There is increasing concern about ethics in the business world. Some of this concern is undoubtedly the result of enlightened self-interest, as when corporate executives say that ethical practices are simply good business practices. For example, in voluntarily paying its workers more than the legally required minimum wage, YumBurger may attract scarce workers in a tight labor market; if it packages its products in an environmentally friendly container, it may attract more purchasers who are environmentally conscious. Other executives may be interested in ethical practices because of the favorable publicity it gives their firms. Corporations may now be more concerned about the possible legal consequences of unethical behavior because of new legislation and more severe penalties for violations.</p>

Although no connection between the poison and Tylenol was established, Johnson &amp; Johnson recalled the product at great cost. James Burke, chair, said that the established ethics credo was invaluable during this crisis because everyone in the firm knew what the standard of ethics required of them, and personnel at various levels were able to make the necessary decisions quickly.</p></li>

</header>
<p id="data-uuid-a9aa0018ad8c4375891b77bfd61fe40b">Educational institutions have responded to the increased need to examine ethics by adding courses, workshops, and programs, and have expanded the study of ethics in existing courses. Typically, topics include fairness in hiring, employment, and promotions; ethical issues in multinational business; ethical issues arising from technology; economic justice; environmental ethics; and ecology.</p>

<h2 id="data-uuid-2f50558f9e3746bb960678414cb6c7a6">Responses of Governments</h2>
</header>
<p id="data-uuid-f28c244a156349f78d9bbd2348d27323">Governments endeavor to protect consumers and the environment and to influence the ethical behavior of business firms in various ways. For example, governments enact legislation and create programs to ensure and encourage ethical behavior. The Federal Sentencing Guidelines provide an incentive for corporations to act more ethically. Under this mandate, when an employee violates a law in the course of his or her employment, a firm can reduce its possible liability if it can show that it took action to develop moral guidelines for its employees. It can have its potential penalties reduced by millions of dollars. This federal mandate has motivated companies to develop codes of conduct, to appoint high-level personnel (often called <em>corporate ethics officers</em>) to oversee compliance and to establish ethics auditing and monitoring systems, and to enforce discipline throughout the firm. Legislators reasoned that if firms integrate ethics into their structure in this way, employees will be less likely to break the law for the company’s benefit and that companies that have taken positive steps to integrate ethics should not be penalized as harshly as those that have not. The guidelines are a response to the public’s desire to hold companies to a higher standard, and to impose on white-collar criminals penalties heavier than those previously imposed.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-943b448675c343e5a4a5760f695f9755">Even the operation of government itself is monitored and regulated. The U.S. Office of Government Ethics, for example, is concerned with the following topics: conflicting financial interests, misuse of position, financial disclosure, impartiality in performing official duties, and other areas of concern. On an international level, federal and state governments require that U.S. firms perform ethically in global markets. For example, the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act prohibits American firms from bribing foreign officials. In addition, diplomatic activities aim to protect American firms from corrupt practices in other countries (see Chapter 36).</p>

</header>
<p id="data-uuid-d9df85cd4e274df982f795946bac3a04">Trade associations develop guidelines for ethical business practices for their diverse memberships. For example, the Direct Marketing Association (DMA) provides self-regulatory standards of conduct for some of the following activities: telephone marketing, sweepstakes, fund-raising, marketing to children, and the collection and use of marketing data. Similarly, many professionals, such as attorneys, are now required annually to successfully complete a minimum number of ethics courses as part of continuing education requirements to maintain their licenses.</p>
