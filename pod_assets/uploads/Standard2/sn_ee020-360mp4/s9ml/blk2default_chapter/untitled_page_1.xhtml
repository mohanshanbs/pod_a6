BP Oil was accused of using shortcuts in its well capping system and also appears to have had an inadequate response system in place for the spill.</p>

            <p id="data-uuid-038f161b7a274a2987ffd65a83f8cb0a">Examples of unethical behavior in professions or government may also affect business. Technology and expansion of global markets have presented businesses with a new array of ethical questions and corresponding unethical behavior. For example, advances in genetics, cloning technology, and the use of stem cells in medical science have all raised ethical issues that were unknown even a decade earlier. Internet, computer technology and social media have all prompted discussions of ethical issues surrounding privacy and free speech (See Chapters 29 and 30). The expansion of global markets has created new ethical issues as well. Is it ethical for an American company to do business with a company in an undemocratic country or one that engages in systemic racial segregation?</p>

Leon Sullivan was a director of the General Motors Corporation who proposed that American companies should ensure that equal employment would be available regardless of race in its South Africa operations, even though South Africa had laws in place at that time requiring racial segregation. These principles were eventually adopted by several hundred other companies doing business in South Africa.</p>
