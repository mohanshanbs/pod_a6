Businesses concerned with ethics usually focus on their corporate responsibility and the development of codes of conduct. Unethical behavior frequently results in unfavorable public relations, loss of consumer goodwill and confidence, and poor employee morale. The threat of legal prosecution and penalties does not eliminate all unethical practices. Sometimes, the driving force for reform may be the individual whistleblower.</p>

                </header>
                <p id="data-uuid-ff65cbf16d0f422488c64506adbea27a">The actions of corporations that are intended to demonstrate their wish to behave responsibly take many forms and are conducted under the banner of corporate responsibility. In some cases, the corporation will “adopt” a nearby school and provide equipment and expert personnel to teach particular skills. In other cases, the firm might construct a park, donate funds to a local symphony orchestra, provide scholarships to a university, or repackage its products to be more environmentally friendly. In some instances, these actions are little more than thinly veiled public relations efforts to enhance the image of the corporation. In other instances, however, corporate actions reflect a moral and ethical concern with social problems and a sincere effort to improve society.</p>
                <p id="data-uuid-6ff5b3724f7c4cefaec0ecd78e57176e">Many states have enacted statutes that allow for profit corporations to include social and environmental benefits into the mission that boards of directors must consider in making decision. These corporations are known as Benefit Corporations or B Corporations.</p>
                <p id="data-uuid-09ebe04ee92d41ad852c0ea786fbacbc">Critics of corporate social action, however, question whether it is appropriate to commit corporate resources to socially desirable goals. It might be better, they suggest, to maximize earnings for shareholders, who could then use the higher earnings to advance society if they so desire. It is interesting to note that in many states, charitable contributions by corporations are legal, while political contributions are not.</p>

To do this, some firms or industries establish a <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-code-of-ethics" epub:type="glossref" role="doc-glossref"><dfn xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="code of ethics">code of ethics</dfn></a>, sometimes called a <em>credo</em> or a values statement, that sets down the principles of ethical behavior expected of personnel in various situations (see <span class="mhhe-link dpg-bar--non_break"><a href="#data-uuid-c39ad43cb7024889b0dda7a37d58ed32">Figure 2.1</a></span>). For example, a firm or industry may place a dollar limit on the value of gifts that may be accepted from suppliers doing business with the firm. A code makes clear that the company expects its personnel to recognize the ethical dimensions of corporate policies and actions.</p>

                    <h2 id="data-uuid-e81e49247d2146a292033c25e63156b8">Whistleblowing</h2>
                </header>
                <p id="data-uuid-45889d9df6c6410ba94e8d96cd51a66d">Our language has a number of derogatory words to describe people who disclose information about wrongdoing. Such terms as “stool pigeon,” “stoolie,” “fink,” “snitch,” “rat,” and “tattletale” suggest that our society does not regard such behavior highly. But despite society’s disdain for informers, certain individuals have been so outraged by what they consider unethical behavior that they have risked widespread condemnation and loss of their jobs to reveal information about the activity. These people are usually termed “whistleblowers.”</p>
                <p id="data-uuid-c693a7efd7f14555888b0095a2827901">Typically, a <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-whistleblower" epub:type="glossref" role="doc-glossref"><dfn xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="whistleblower">whistleblower</dfn></a> is a person who reveals to a governmental authority, or to news media, confidential information concerning some wrongdoing or conduct that he or she regards as unethical and/or illegal. The information may have come to him or her in the course of employment or in other ways. The whistleblower may be a secretary, for example, who knows that his or her boss is cheating customers or the company or an engineer who knows that a product is unsafe and that purchasers of the product could be injured or killed. Authorities may respond by prosecuting the company. The media may publicize the wrongdoing, which can be equally damaging to a firm. In addition to illegal and fraudulent activities, employees are also now exposing other misconduct, such as conflicts of interest, sexual harassment, and discrimination.</p>
                <p id="data-uuid-f961e63d6f814b3db5be33594f524a3c">The whistleblower, too, may be confronted with an ethical dilemma. Often the choice is between remaining silent or revealing information that could result in adverse effects on the firm that may cause many coworkers to lose their jobs.</p>
                <p id="data-uuid-b6e380591cf24adfa92801fc31903330">It is not surprising that retaliation is frequently the result of speaking out. The whistleblower is often regarded as an outcast to the organization or to peers, is often passed over for promotions and raises, and may even be subject to physical attacks to his or her person or property. The federal government and many states have statutes that protect whistleblowers from retaliation. Still, with the possible exception of certain individuals who may have a personal grudge, the usual motivation behind whistleblowing is the outrage to a person’s sense of ethics.</p>
                <p id="data-uuid-67e3b153497c49e797640f2ef50010d5">The federal government has now enacted programs to encourage whistleblowing by providing financial incentives for doing so. For example, the Securities and Exchange Commission, in an effort to enhance its reputation, has established a program to reward whistleblowers with a percentage of penalties imposed. The Internal Revenue Service also has a similar program to reward the reporting of illegal tax activities.</p>

What is the most effective way to achieve this? The corporation may indeed adhere to the highest ethical practices, but a new chief executive officer (CEO) or board of directors may discontinue those practices if they reduce profits or otherwise adversely affect the firm. Further government regulation could ensure compliance with ethical standards, but such an arrangement might require a costly and oppressive bureaucracy. The ideal is for responsible individuals, industry organizations, and watchdog groups to encourage corporations and governments to reach mutually agreed-upon ethical practices.</p>
