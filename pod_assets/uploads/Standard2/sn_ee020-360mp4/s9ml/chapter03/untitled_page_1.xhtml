            <p id="data-uuid-1b3b803126d346afbf04c09942d0b56b">The law assures each person certain rights and assigns each person certain duties. As was discussed in Chapter 1, the law enforcement authorities of federal, state, and local governments enforce specific laws called <em>statutes</em> that are designed to protect the public at large. A violation of a statute is a <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-crime" epub:type="glossref" role="doc-glossref"><dfn xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="crime">crime</dfn></a>. A private wrong that causes injury to another person’s physical well-being, property, or reputation is called a <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-tort" epub:type="glossref" role="doc-glossref"><dfn xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="tort">tort</dfn></a>.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-5470019408084ee6abc2a2bc046902de">It is important to note that a certain action can be both a crime and a tort. For example, a person who operates an automobile recklessly or negligently and causes injury to another, or damages his or her property, has committed both the crime of reckless driving and the tort of negligence. The reckless driver can be prosecuted by the appropriate law enforcement authorities for the crime and also can be sued for the tort in a civil court by the person whose property was damaged or who was injured. Chapter 4 is devoted to torts and how they may relate to both personal and business life.</p>

            <p id="data-uuid-1d3224b23049437b93a4accf688ef1b7">At times, a corporation may be held criminally liable for the actions or omissions of its employees. In general, if a criminal offense is punishable by imprisonment, the corporation is not held liable; instead, courts usually punish corporations by requiring that they pay fines. However, it must be noted that, when corporations do pay these fines, it is the shareholders who are ultimately the ones being punished.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-248ee2417d1a46cdb3f674277c756d49">While statutory law determines what is and what is not a crime, many statutes reflect legal principles derived from common law. What makes a particular act, or failure to act, a crime? Why is a certain act, or failure to act, a crime in one state and not in another? Why is a certain act, or failure to act, a crime one day and not the next? These questions can all be answered by one statement: An act, or failure to act, is a crime because the governing statutes say it is. Of course, a high degree of uniformity has emerged among states, so it is uncommon for a particular act to be legal in one state and illegal in another. Also, legislatures attempt to reflect the public interest and will enact legislation that makes a certain act a crime if there is sufficient demand.</p>
            <p id="data-uuid-94c4ac9d6c88432d9bc74f0f6a7ca1ab">In other instances, also reflecting changing public sentiments, legislatures and courts may decide that a particular act previously considered a crime should no longer be viewed as a violation of the law. For example, laws concerning abortion, homosexuality, and drug abuse have been modified considerably in recent years. Similarly, a legislature may repeal statutes, thus making an act legal when it previously had been a crime.</p>
