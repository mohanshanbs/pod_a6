His restaurant had a difficult time competing with Green Apple Snak Shoppe, located across the street. It seemed that whenever Plum Pudding offered a new special price on a particular meal, its competitor met the price and offered some other inducement as well. As a last desperate effort to remain in business, Williamson hired a “torch” to set fire to the Green Apple. Just as the hired criminal had finished his work, he was apprehended by an off-duty police officer. The hired “torch” admitted his guilt and implicated Williamson.</p>

The drug had been found to cure several serious diseases. As soon as news of the approval became public, Franken reasoned, the price of the firm’s stock would increase substantially. He arranged with a friend to buy thousands of shares of the company’s stock, hoping to sell at a profit after the price increased as a result of the good news.

However, Searle was not authorized to sign them. Each time he wanted to pay invoices, Searle had to have the firm’s president sign them. After some months, he was able to copy the president’s signature. He had invoices printed for a nonexistent company, and periodically he made out checks to the fake company and signed the president’s signature. Ultimately his wrongdoings were discovered. Is it likely Searle will be prosecuted for his crime?</p>
