<p id="data-uuid-b9f457bc217d4e41844869d7565a328c">Many people associate crime with criminals and gangsters as they are portrayed on television and in the movies. Crimes, however, are not always committed in the sensational style of blazing guns and wild car chases. Often the site of a business crime is the well-appointed office of a corporate executive, his or her private club, or a nearby bar where employees meet after work.</p>

<p id="data-uuid-6ca9ab0c73ee425b942e2b6843495079"><a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-white-collar-crime" epub:type="glossref" role="doc-glossref"><dfn xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="white-collar crime">White-collar crime</dfn></a> is the term used to describe various crimes that typically do not involve force or violence committed by and against businesses. Originally white-collar crime related only to nonviolent crimes against businesses, usually committed by their own employees. The most common white-collar crime was the theft of an employer’s funds by employees with access to such funds (embezzlement). In recent years, however, this unofficial category of illegal activity has been applied to nonviolent crimes committed <em>by</em> business firms as well as <em>against</em> business firms. In this newer, broader application, white-collar crime covers a wide range of crimes, including stock swindles, frauds against insurance companies, credit card fraud, income tax evasion, cyberspace fraud and theft of computer programs, agreements with competitors to fix prices, and others. Depending on its seriousness, a white-collar crime can be either a felony or a misdemeanor and can violate federal or state law.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-82abb3ae82c24de794e15e67c4f7e53b">The Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of 1970, also known as <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-RICO" epub:type="glossref" role="doc-glossref"><dfn xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="RICO">RICO</dfn></a>, is one of the most successful laws used to combat white-collar crime. Originally created to restrict the entry of organized crime into legitimate businesses, RICO prohibits an organization’s employees from engaging in a pattern of racketeering activity. Some examples of the wide variety of crimes considered to be racketeering activities are securities fraud, mail fraud, wire fraud, bribery, acts of violence, and embezzlement from pension funds. Under the RICO act, it is easier to both prosecute corrupt organizations and seize assets obtained through corruption. In addition, under RICO, a person who suffers damages to his or her business or property may sue for treble damages, an amount equal to three times actual damages.</p>

Madoff’s Ponzi scheme operated for years by promising steady gains to investors during all economic climates; however, the scheme failed when Madoff was unable to meet increased demands for withdrawals resulting from investor uncertainty in the stock market. In the end, total losses to Madoff’s investors, including charity organizations, pension funds, celebrities, and average investors, totaled more than $20 billion. The court found Madoff guilty of securities fraud and, because of the egregious nature of his corrupt acts, sentenced him to serve 150 years in a federal prison. Subsequently, Peter Madoff, the chief compliance officer and younger brother of Bernard Madoff, admitted his role in the scheme and pleaded guilty to conspiracy and falsifying records. Sentenced to 10 years in prison, he was the eighth person to plead guilty.</p></li>

Some states have broadened the definition of arson to include the burning of a house by its owner and the destruction of property by other means, such as by explosion. Aside from the few persons who start fires for irrational reasons, most instances of arson are profit related. When the motivation is profit, the arsonist is usually trying to collect money from an insurance company for a building that he or she owns. Most states have statutes that provide for the punishment of persons who burn their own property with the aim of collecting insurance money. Such statutes establish a special category of crime called <a href="../glossary.xhtml#key-burning-to-defraud" epub:type="glossref" role="doc-glossref"><dfn xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="burning to defraud">burning to defraud</dfn></a>. To combat these practices, the insurance industry has developed very sophisticated investigation techniques and has an impressive record of assisting in successful prosecutions.</p>

Desperate, Filkins hired an arsonist to set the building on fire one night when Filkins had an unshakable alibi. The building, inventory, and equipment were insured. Insurance investigators and the fire marshal found evidence of arson and caught the criminal, who identified Filkins as the person who had hired him. The insurance company refused to pay for the loss, and Filkins and the arsonist were both charged with the crime of arson.</p></li>

Some jobs, such as accountant, cashier, and bank teller, generally provide more opportunity for embezzlement than other jobs where the employee has little contact with money. The use of computers in business has led to some ingenious schemes for embezzling.</p>

<p id="data-uuid-5af8449664d7428d937d0d9c0fcea968">Credit cards provide cardholders with many conveniences, but certain individuals have seized the opportunity for illegal gain by using stolen or counterfeit credit cards. Frequently, persons with knowledge of computers access the credit card numbers of consumers who have made purchases on the Internet and use these credit card numbers without authorization. In addition, the practice of obtaining credit cards under false pretenses continues to plague banks, credit card issuers, and consumers.</p>

</header>
<p id="data-uuid-785a9ee807e24cbf8f14a6147fb22dfc">Identity theft occurs when an unscrupulous individual steals the name and personal information of someone else by stealing private mail, by obtaining personal data on the Internet, or by soliciting personal information from an unwitting victim over the telephone. The person stealing another’s identity does so in order to obtain credit cards and other types of loans, with no intention of ever repaying these. It is, therefore, as important to protect one’s identity as it is to protect one’s credit cards.</p>
