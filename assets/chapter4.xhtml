<p id="data-uuid-f13b3a06a4194c9db2126313650b9acf">The new product development process consists of three main activities and eight specific tasks. Failure at any step significantly lowers the probability of long-term success. The three major activities in new product development are to (1) identify product opportunities, (2) define the product opportunity, and (3) develop the product opportunity.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-089622b4743649459ec5fe06f9bfa951">There is a great deal of variability in the new product development timeline. Marketers must balance the product development process with the ever-changing demands of the marketplace. Take too long in product development and the market may have changed; rush the process and the product may be poorly designed or lack quality.<a class="dpg-bar--non_break" href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/remarks.xhtml#ch08-030" epub:type="noteref"><sup>30</sup></a></p>

<p id="data-uuid-41a1b99830b146cc97f54974f1ffffae">The first step in the new product development process, identify potential product opportunities, has two specific tasks. First, companies must generate sufficient new product ideas. Very few product ideas make it through the entire process and, as we have seen already, far fewer products actually become successful. As a result, it is important to have a steady flow of new ideas into the development process. Second, ideas need to be evaluated before resources are committed to development.</p>

</header>
<p id="data-uuid-caa5919a8ea6486bad4c9437194c4c0d">Product ideas are generated in one of two ways: internal or external to the firm. While companies develop a preference for one approach over the other, the reality is that both internal and external sources produce good new product ideas. A number of factors, including the company’s commitment to innovation, the reputation of competitors for new product development, and customer expectations, affect which approach a company prefers.<a class="dpg-bar--non_break" href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/remarks.xhtml#ch08-031" epub:type="noteref"><sup>31</sup></a></p>
<p id="data-uuid-2db362087fcc4d62999efda313c5b778"><span class="runin">Internal</span> Sources include employees from R&amp;D, marketing, and manufacturing. Key employees know both the capabilities of the company and the needs of the market. Therefore, it is not surprising that internal sources are the single best source for new product ideas. Funding product research is expensive; companies spend billions of dollars every year to generate product ideas.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-8156516ff28d4a8fa849866498977a16">People who work directly with customers are another source of ideas. As salespeople, customer service representatives, and others interact directly with customers, it is possible to identify new product ideas. Often these ideas are incremental changes to existing products that solve a particular problem; however, occasionally the customer challenge requires a truly innovative solution.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-1de6924ac8ef42ef8ff2b5ed331b9972">Working with academia helps support the research activities of many organizations. Under Armour (UA) established a partnership with Johns Hopkins Medicine to conduct health and fitness research and develop UA’s connected fitness platforms. UA currently has the largest connected fitness community in the world with over 190 million registered users. Through this agreement, UA is able to develop and market new products based on medical research as experts from Johns Hopkins provide research, insights, and recommendations on sleep, fitness, activity, and nutrition to improve UA’s connected fitness community.<a class="dpg-bar--non_break" href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/remarks.xhtml#ch08-032" epub:type="noteref"><sup>32</sup></a></p>
<p id="data-uuid-94687fa0f3364f519d0413cccc674a27"><span class="runin">External</span> An excellent source of ideas comes from individuals and organizations not directly connected with the company. In some industries, such as Internet applications, small entrepreneurs drive innovation. Instagram is a popular Internet destination owned by Facebook. Started by entrepreneurs in 2010 who wanted to share files across social media platforms, the company has over 1200 million registered users. The company’s acquisition by Facebook exemplifies how larger companies continue to grow by acquiring smaller companies with innovative products. Google, Microsoft, and Apple all maintain dedicated staff whose job it is to identify and acquire new start-up organizations with great product ideas.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-a57846a71bea41b1b960a826887226e2"><span class="runin">Customers</span> Customers are also an excellent source of product ideas. Solving their problems can lead to innovative solutions that have market potential beyond the immediate customer. Many companies encourage customer input directly online through e-mail and online discussion groups. Ford, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and others sponsor user group bulletin boards that discuss improvements to existing products. While this will not likely lead to “new-to-the-world” products, it can lead to incremental or even substantial enhancements to existing products.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-22686a91b68a4a5cb00e563d3f9cad5d"><span class="runin">Distributors</span> Distributors are a good source for new product ideas, particularly when they are the primary link between the customer and the company. Small organizations <span id="page231" class="page-number">Page 231</span>generally do not have the resources for a national sales force and use distributors in many markets. The distributor network is a key partner in the development of new products for the company. In actuality, almost anyone outside the organization can generate a new product idea.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-bdfc5806ed094ade875df8de4a53eaa7">Companies understand that even though the majority of ideas from external sources will not pass the screening process, they still want to encourage people to submit their product concepts. HP gets thousands of product ideas from a variety of individuals every year; however, very few are actually developed.</p>

</header>
<p id="data-uuid-ab4df9490d2d4bad97e69524a5929181">Ideas need to be screened and evaluated as quickly as possible. The screening process has two primary objectives. The first objective is to eliminate product ideas judged unworthy of further consideration. New product development is expensive and resources are scarce, so ideas are evaluated early to assess their viability. An idea is rejected for several reasons. Perhaps the proposal is just not very good or it may be reasonable but inconsistent with the company’s overall business strategy. Evaluating ideas can sometimes create difficult choices for managers as they wrestle with broader societal issues.<a class="dpg-bar--non_break" href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/remarks.xhtml#ch08-033" epub:type="noteref"><sup>33</sup></a> Consider the challenge of creating “kid friendly” television for young children. Netflix has created a number of shows that seek to provide an educational experience in an entertaining way to kids of various ages. Shows like <i>Ask the Storybots</i> answer questions on a variety of topics—with a group of friendly, funny bots.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-772bd6b8c66b4f81820c9b016eece3a2">Two types of mistakes are associated with rejecting or moving forward with a new product design, and both are potentially expensive for the company. The first is the <a href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/glossary.xhtml#key-go-to-market-mistake" epub:type="glossref"><dfn xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="go-to-market mistake">go-to-market mistake</dfn></a> made when a company fails to stop a bad product idea from moving into product development. This mistake runs on a continuum from very costly (the new product is not accepted and the company loses its initial investment) to not meeting targeted ROI projections (the product does not hit established benchmarks for profitability, or unit sales). Expensive mistakes often initiate a review of the screening process to figure out how the product made it through the development process. When the product fails to hit targeted benchmarks for success, the review may focus on errors in marketing strategy, target market adjustments, or competitive response to the product launch.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-d8544cd7ea7d45309b8ba1fd22f35690">A <a href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/glossary.xhtml#key-stop-to-market-mistake" epub:type="glossref"><dfn xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="stop-to-market mistake">stop-to-market mistake</dfn></a> happens when a good idea is prematurely eliminated during the screening process. Almost every CEO can relate a story of the product success that got away. Most often companies are reluctant to talk about stop-to-market mistakes because it makes management uncomfortable and provides additional information about product development to competitors. For example, we have talked a lot about Apple, pointing out its wildly successful iPhone and iPad. But in addition to its failed Newton, which we discussed earlier, the company has also developed a number of other products that never made it to market. For example, the Macintosh PowerBook Duo Tablet was, arguably, the first tablet PC and was created in the early 1990s during the same period as Newton. Apple stopped development of the product, code-named PenLite, to avoid confusion with Newton. Among PenLite’s many features was a wireless, full-function computer that connected with all PowerBook accessories.<a class="dpg-bar--non_break" href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/remarks.xhtml#ch08-034" epub:type="noteref"><sup>34</sup></a></p>

The criteria used to prioritize ideas vary by company but often include:</p>

<p id="data-uuid-72cd1cb4967c4dcda2d98bf9a4940c4d">Ideas that pass through the screening process move into a development phase to define the product potential and market opportunity. Three specific tasks in this stage are to (1) define and test the product idea, (2) create a marketing strategy for the product, and (3) analyze the product’s business case.</p>

</header>
<p id="data-uuid-58fc525e07144447b727bc430d601c5e">The product idea now needs to be clearly defined and tested. Ideas at this stage are frequently not fully developed or operational. At this point, depending on the concept, people and resources are allocated to move the product development forward and a budget is created to develop the product.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-e305dfe95a0a4b689342dbbe3ea88a12">Product definition has three objectives. First, it defines the product’s value proposition: what customer needs are being addressed and, in broad terms, at what price. Second, the definition briefly identifies the target market(s) and the purchase frequency. Third, the definition delineates the product’s characteristics (look, feel, physical elements, and features of the product). As the product moves through development, the physical characteristics become more defined and particular features, often at different price points, are included in the prototypes.<a class="dpg-bar--non_break" href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/remarks.xhtml#ch08-037" epub:type="noteref"><sup>37</sup></a></p>
<p id="data-uuid-cb9e443ab1e14f7298cca8c95a800340">Target customers are useful in defining the product concept. Companies present models, limited prototypes, and verbal or written descriptions of the product concept to customers, individually or in focus groups. Computer graphics are also used to depict elements of the product and even functionality. For example, in the development of new jet airliners, Boeing and Airbus develop sophisticated simulations that allow passengers to <i>virtually</i> sit in the airplane. In this way, customers get a more realistic perspective at a fraction of the cost to develop a full-scale working prototype.</p>

</figure>
<p id="data-uuid-ddeacc47dc11404ea48d5df321f230f5">During this phase, companies start getting market input to refine and develop the concept. Customers are asked about their attitudes toward the product idea and if they perceive the idea as different from other products on the market. Product developers want to know, Would you buy this product and how much are you willing to pay? The company needs to know if the product is appealing to the target audience. A second question is also essential in this testing: What would you like to change about the product concept? If customers suggest changes that are not feasible (too costly to implement, not technically possible), it dramatically reduces the viability of the project. Whenever possible, however, customer feedback is incorporated into the product’s development. By making adjustments during this phase rather than waiting until after the launch, companies can increase the probability of success. Since the information is so critical, researchers use large samples of target customers to ensure confidence in the findings.</p>

As the product becomes better defined, marketing specialists develop a tentative, but detailed, marketing strategy. Even though the product is still under development, there are several reasons for preparing a marketing strategy now. First, defining the target market is helpful to the product developers. In addition to the basic market information (size, geography, and demographics), product developers appreciate knowing how the product will be used (context, environment) and the psychographics of the market (the market’s activities, interests, and opinions). Marketers also assess the market share potential at critical points in time (how much market share can the new product get after one year?). At this point, tentative pricing, distribution, and marketing <span id="page233" class="page-number">Page 233</span>communications strategies are created that will be adapted as the product gets closer to rollout.<a class="dpg-bar--non_break" href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/remarks.xhtml#ch08-038" epub:type="noteref"><sup>38</sup></a> Often, as part of the initial marketing communications, appropriate publications will include articles about a new product.

<p id="data-uuid-f4ca61cdb2454ee5a7b30db5f382bee8">As the product definition is developed and a tentative marketing strategy created, a critical “go–no go” decision is made before the next product development stage. At this point, the costs have been small relative to the cost of moving to full product development, market testing, and launch. There is a lot of pressure to get the decision right because a mistake is expensive. The <a href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/glossary.xhtml#key-business-case-analysis" epub:type="glossref"><dfn xmlns="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" title="business case analysis">business case analysis</dfn></a> is an overall evaluation of a product and usually assesses the product’s probability of success. It is often done when there are changes to an existing marketing plan, such as an increase in the marketing communications budget.

First, the total demand for the product over a specified period of time, usually five years, is determined. Second, a cash flow statement is developed that specifies cash flow, profitability, and investment requirements.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-d58fdc1e64e44a80b836de8a15fd7367"><span class="runin">Total Demand</span> Sales are defined in two ways: revenue (unit sales × price) and unit sales. Each provides important information. Revenue is the top line number in a profitability analysis and is affected by price variations common to global products with substantial price differences around the world. Because currencies fluctuate, which can lead to wide variations in revenue, and price increases can also dramatically affect total revenue, unit sales is often considered a more realistic picture of product growth and represents the number of units sold, in various product configurations, around the world.</p>

<p id="data-uuid-aa8d5c6ec20b4bbd809110c98299eb0c">If the result of the previous analysis is a “go” decision, then the number of people and the resources allocated to the product’s development increase substantially. For much of the 20th century, companies would move a substantial number of new product concepts through to this stage and use product development and market testing to screen and eliminate ideas. That changed in the 1990s as the cost of taking products to market increased dramatically while failure rates remained high. Companies now screen product ideas much earlier in the development process. As a result, far fewer product ideas make it to this stage, and those products targeted for further development and market testing have a much higher probability of actually being launched in the marketplace.<a class="dpg-bar--non_break" href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/remarks.xhtml#ch08-040" epub:type="noteref"><sup>40</sup></a> In a classic article in the <i>Harvard Business</i> <i>Review</i> on the myths of product development, Thomke and Reinertsen define one main fallacy as the belief that more features create a better product. Increasing the number of features <span id="page234" class="page-number">Page 234</span>on a product can sometimes simply lead to confusion and frustrate customers. Often, customers desire simplicity and want a product that is easy to use. Amazon’s Echo, for example, is a successful high-tech but easy-to-use product. Consumers of all ages can easily use the hands-free Bluetooth speaker and access the Alexa Voice Service by simply speaking.<a class="dpg-bar--non_break" href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/remarks.xhtml#ch08-041" epub:type="noteref"><sup>41</sup></a></p>

</header>
<p id="data-uuid-81e5035eb6174a97b0dbc69e8700f4d5">So far the product exists primarily as a concept, or, at most a working prototype, but if the product idea is to go forward, it must move from viable product concept to a working product that meets customer needs profitably. The challenge for the development team is to design and build a product the customer wants to buy while hitting the company’s success metrics—sales price, revenue, profit margins, unit sales, and cost to build.<a class="dpg-bar--non_break" href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/remarks.xhtml#ch08-042" epub:type="noteref"><sup>42</sup></a></p>
<p id="data-uuid-76f5802caff5459aa9387189ad77ef7e">Previous research during concept testing provides substantial information about what customers are looking for in the product. Coupled with input from engineers, designers, and marketing specialists, the product definition developed earlier is operationalized. This process moves from a strategic understanding of the customer’s basic needs to a specific operational definition of the product’s characteristics. Following this process, the product’s physical characteristics are defined by targeting the essential benefits delivered to the customer.<a class="dpg-bar--non_break" href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/remarks.xhtml#ch08-043" epub:type="noteref"><sup>43</sup></a></p>
<p id="data-uuid-4050ab9f2ce043479aea127e6521ab84">There are two product development models. The first incorporates more planning and follows a sequential timeline with key process metrics being met at each stage before moving on through the process. In this scenario, product development spends a lot of time creating a product that is considered close to the final product that will be rolled out to customers. Consequently, product testing is used primarily to affirm the extensive development done earlier in the process.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-0f137b399c8d4261bc4f5145ff14a4b0">The next approach encourages more prototypes that incrementally move the product through the development process. Here the product does not need to be “perfect” before testing; rather, the idea is to continuously test the product and use the testing process to enhance the product and solicit customer feedback. Through this process, the market becomes aware of the product, and if properly managed, interest in the product is increased during development.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-61f642eb94884fe196e204fa9b621d4c">In this second method, the goal is to shorten the time spent in development, moving from development to testing as quickly as possible to minimize cost and get the product in the hands of potential users. The longer a company takes at this stage, the greater the likelihood that competitors learn of the product, customer preferences change, or external environment conditions dictate further product adjustments.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-fccf3b0c69b145f4a86b51b87ded148a"><span class="runin">Product Testing</span> Generally a product undergoes two types of testing. As the product’s characteristics are being finalized, most of the testing is done internally by engineers, product specialists, and other employees. This type of testing, called alpha testing, helps clarify the basic operationalization of the product such as the physical characteristics and features.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-59510309b7404965857df0cc09da55eb">At some point, the company will want potential customers to begin testing the product. Beta testing encourages customers to evaluate and provide feedback on the prototype. The product may be close to the final configuration, but beta tests allow for further product testing and refinement.<a class="dpg-bar--non_break" href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/remarks.xhtml#ch08-044" epub:type="noteref"><sup>44</sup></a></p>

</header>
<p id="data-uuid-f139a8025d6443279c12c9287e227f3a">Once the product has reached the point where the product development team is satisfied with its performance, physical characteristics, and features, it is ready to be tested in the marketplace. To maintain security, minimize product information leaks, and disrupt competitor intelligence, products are often given code names. Once the product moves to the marketplace testing stage, a marketing strategy is created for the test using the product’s market name. Some elements of the strategy such as brand name and packaging will have been tested with consumers during product development.<a class="dpg-bar--non_break" href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/remarks.xhtml#ch08-045" epub:type="noteref"><sup>45</sup></a> For example, engineers work with package design professionals to ensure that, first, the product is protected and, second, the packaging maximizes marketing communications opportunities.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-ed01663991ba4bf78052838ea5906340">The amount of market testing is a function of several critical factors that are in conflict with one another. First, a company must evaluate the cost of being wrong. While a great deal of money has been spent to this point, the cost of launching a product failure is much higher. The greater the risk of failure, the more market testing a company will want to do before a full product launch.</p>
<span id="page235" class="page-number">Page 235</span>
<p id="data-uuid-50417650ebab4bec98436f142d56b40a">At the same time, market testing takes time, and competitors can take advantage to enhance their product mix or develop marketing strategies to counter a successful product launch. In addition, depending on the product, the selling season may dictate faster product rollout because waiting too long may cost the company significant sales. Ultimately, management must balance these factors and choose the optimum market testing strategy.<a class="dpg-bar--non_break" href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/remarks.xhtml#ch08-046" epub:type="noteref"><sup>46</sup></a></p>

<ul class="bulleted-list" id="data-uuid-459498316fd0405692ab070f6dc4ec25">
<li id="data-uuid-8a8ca999db1a4b7ab61154ac768a02bb"><p id="data-uuid-a1965a85c6ff44178306de8aea986f02"><i>Where:</i> The location of the market test is based on how well it reflects the potential target markets. Most market tests involve somewhere between two and five cities to mitigate regional differences in purchase patterns (if there are any).</p></li>
<li id="data-uuid-2725f725b1c742e69da63e12e7d1c6e0"><p id="data-uuid-4cf983108ce745f3a21db4660c7ec9ff"><i>How long:</i> Most test markets run less than a year. The test should be long enough to include several purchase cycles. With many consumer products, purchase cycles are relatively short (days or weeks) so there is less need for a long market test.</p></li>
<li id="data-uuid-d331507418d64dbabb514db68c6bd3c3"><p id="data-uuid-06971ac41d0e4489bc96a649e10142ce"><i>Data:</i> Critical information needed to make necessary decisions must be identified. Management frequently wants to know how long it takes for the product to move through the distribution system, tracking the product from manufacturing plant through to the point of sale (matching inventory as it leaves the plant with store sales). In addition, buyers are interviewed on their product experience.</p></li>
<li id="data-uuid-e443f09b018546b8b38c24d5bba17429"><p id="data-uuid-a9c164d28dbe4b36b08ec302c7013e1f"><i>Decision criteria:</i> Metrics for further action must be identified. At this stage it is difficult to pull a product, but if the product fails in the market test, management is faced with a difficult decision—drop the product or send it back for major redesign. If the product is a success, then the product launch decision is much easier. <a class="mhhe-link dpg-bar--non_break" href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/chapter008/ch08_reader_04.xhtml#data-uuid-d98b5c2bb9934934a317f2f3661e5b44">Exhibit 8.10</a> is a summary of the decision criteria used in market tests.</p></li>

<p id="data-uuid-525258ef0e0c49a1a69acfcee4fa976a"><span id="page236" class="page-number">Page 236</span>Consumer product market testing has two goals. The first is to provide specific numbers to the business case estimates including new (trial purchases), repeat, and, if appropriate, initial replacement purchases. Additionally, information about buyer demographics is evaluated against earlier target market scenarios and is compared against company business case models and historical data. The company takes data from the market test and projects the future.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-e522ccbd6b6c4cf68255cb36b7fc9e31">The second objective of market testing is to get feedback on the tactics that can be used to adjust the marketing plan before product launch. While a company will often hold back implementing the entire marketing plan for security reasons, input from customers, distributors, and retailers is helpful in adjusting the final marketing plan.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-458d6e32accb4e8caf1a9a7ea8c67b8c"><span class="runin">Business Product Market Test</span> Products designed for business markets are tested differently than their consumer product counterparts. Essentially, the tests are smaller in scope and involve fewer individuals and companies; however, they are no less important in the new product development process. Because business markets are smaller, beta testing often includes only a few key customers with a long-standing company relationship. If, on the other hand, the company has independent distributors, it identifies a limited number for the market test and provides additional support to them as the product is being tested.<a class="dpg-bar--non_break" href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/remarks.xhtml#ch08-047" epub:type="noteref"><sup>47</sup></a></p>
<p id="data-uuid-ed178d21a58c481a8b9bf6cb6216afec">Often in parallel with beta testing, companies will use trade shows to solicit customer feedback. Trade shows are a cost-effective way to get customer input because they are an efficient and convenient location to introduce new products or test new product ideas.</p>

</header>
<p id="data-uuid-d9f9548e7f6b4fed8d7865dcd55b0bf5">At this point in the new product process, it is time to implement the marketing plan. By now, considerable time, money, and human capital have been expended in the development of the product. Management has made the decision to launch the product. Now it is time to define the product’s objectives (sales, target markets, success metrics), specify the value proposition, plan the marketing tactics, and implement the marketing plan. As we mentioned earlier, all of this will already have been done, but any necessary adjustments are made after the market test.</p>
<p id="data-uuid-7d209c4683604594a0b52d89c48be618">The product launch is critical to the long-term success of the product. Products that start poorly seldom recover from a poor launch. The pressure to create excitement, particularly for consumer products, leading to consumer trial purchase is a primary reason companies spend millions of dollars on a product launch. Netgear, a leading provider of networking devices, introduced the world’s first tri-band mesh network to good reviews and broad customer acceptance. While other companies were earlier to market with mesh network systems, Netgear took a different approach with a unique tri-band system that outperforms the competition.<a class="dpg-bar--non_break" href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/remarks.xhtml#ch08-048" epub:type="noteref"><sup>48</sup></a></p>
<p id="data-uuid-6eb2d69e073c4db48777892f510d7a8b">Many marketing communication dollars are front-loaded at the product launch with the goal of creating sufficient product interest that will turn into repeat and replacement purchases later. If the product is not successful early, management is often unwilling to spend additional dollars as the product becomes widely distributed. The end result can be a downward spiral with low product interest generating fewer sales, which leads to more cutbacks in marketing support.<a class="dpg-bar--non_break" href="http://172.24.175.33/PrinceXML_new/uploads/sn_7aa4-1080mp4/s9ml/remarks.xhtml#ch08-049" epub:type="noteref"><sup>49</sup></a></p>
